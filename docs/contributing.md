## Local workflow

```sh
mise install
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm verify
pnpm docs:build
```

`pnpm verify` is the library gate: Biome, Markdown linting, strict TypeScript 7, coverage, the dual
ESM/CommonJS build, `publint`, Are The Types Wrong, a packed-tarball content check and a
clean-consumer install against npmjs for each supported CanvasEngine release. `pnpm docs:build`
validates and renders the Sourcey site.

Branch from `main`, make a focused Conventional Commit, open a pull request, and keep the branch
current by merging `main` into it when necessary. The protected path uses automated checks rather
than a routine human approval; merge commits preserve the constituent history. Do not hand-edit
versions or `CHANGELOG.md`: Release Please owns them.

A new patch needs a scenario in `tests/support/scenarios.ts` that reproduces the defect on the real
CanvasEngine class, and a matrix test that shows it failing without the patch. Read the repository
[contribution guide](https://github.com/jbcom/rpgjs-patches/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[agent instructions](https://github.com/jbcom/rpgjs-patches/blob/main/AGENTS.md) first.
